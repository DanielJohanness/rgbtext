        <h2>JUDUL</h2>
        <p>Long long time ago, there lived a great king in Bengkulu. His name is king Ratu Agung. He ruled Sungai Serut Kingdom for years and during those years, the people in the kingdom live peacefully and prosperous. The king has seven children. The last
            child was the only daughter in the family and her name is Putri Gading Cempaka.
            <br> Putri Gading Cempaka was very beautiful and kind. There were so many noble man came to their kingdom to propose the princess but her father, king Ratu Agung, refused all of them because for him Putri Gading Cempaka was still too young
            to get married.
            <br> One day, the king summon all of his children into his room. At that moment he was so weak and he said to all of them “My children, I think my time has come to leave you. I hope you all can keep your relationship as brother and sister.
            I have two important message that I want to tell you before I die. First, I appointed Anak Dalam as my sixth son to be the next king of our kingdom. I hope you all can accept my decision. Second, if a big disaster ever happened on this land
            and you think that there is nothing you can do to save it, go to Bungkuk mountain and stay there. Wait until a great king came to propose my daughter”. All of his children listened to his message carefully. None of them complained about it.
            A couple days later, the king passed away.
            <br> All people in the kingdom mourned the king’s death. Putri Gading Cempaka and all of her brothers burried their father in a special place. A couple days after the burial ceremony, they started to carry out their father’s will. They held
            the crowning ceremony of Anak Dalam to replace their father as the new king. For some reasons, they decided to change the name of the kingdom into Bangkahulu kingdom. Just like his father, Anak Dalam lead the kingdom wisely and the people
            love him so much.
            <br> One day, a prince of Aceh kingdom came to their land. He brought along with him so many people and present because he wanted to propose Putri Gading Cempaka. He sent some of his soldiers and counselor to the palace to see king Anak Dalam.
            When they arrived at the palace, the counselor stated their intention to the king. King Anak Dalam told the counselor that they couldn’t accept the prince proposal because they had to keep their promise to their father. After that the counselor
            and the soldiers returned to their ship and report the result to the prince.
            <Br> The prince was so angry tohear the news from his counselor. He felt that king Anak Dalam and his brother had insulted him with their decision. So he challenged king Anak Dalam to a war. The big war was inevitable and it last for days with
            so many casualties. At that moment, king Anak Dalam and his brothers realized that this may be the right time to cary out their father’s second will. So they decided to bring anything they can and they flee to Bungkuk mountain with some survivors
            of the war.
            <Br> When king Anak Dalam and his people flee from the kingdom, the prince from Aceh also returned to his kingdom. This condition left Bangkahulu kingdom to be empty and unguarded. Hearing the news, some noble men from Lebong Balik Bukit came
            to the kingdom and tried to claim it. But, instead of combining their power to claim the throne, those noble men fight each other over the throne. A couple weeks later, a wise man by the name Maharaja Sakti came to the land and brought all
            of the noble men into an agreement.
            <Br> The noble men realized that they cannot be a king so they asked Maharaja Sakti to be their king and claimed Bangkahulu kingdom. Maharaja Sakti agreed to their idea so they held a crowning ceremony at the palace. On the day of the ceremony,
            a big storm suddenly appeared in the kingdom. They canceled the ceremony and they waited for the storm to be over. But the storm was not getting lighter.
            <Br> Maharaja Sakti was curious about the storm, it was as if as he was not meant to held the crowning ceremony. So he decided to ask to his shaman about the unusual condition. The shaman told him that if he wanted to be the king of the kingdom,
            he should wed the descendant of the rightful king. After that, Maharaja Sakti asked the shaman to locate the princess whereabout. The shaman used his magical power and he found that the princess was in Bungkuk mountain with her brothers.
            <br> Maharaja Sakti sent some of his soldiers and his counselor to go to Bungkuk mountain to deliver his message to the princess and her brother. When they arrived at Bungkuk mountain, they went to Putri Gading Cempaka’s location right away
            and they stated their intention to her and her brother. Putri Gading Cempaka and her brothers realized that this was exactly the same as their father told them before he die, so they gladly accept the proposal.
            <Br> After that, Putri Gading Cempaka and her brothers along with the soldiers which were sent to deliver the message from Maharaja Sakti returned to Bangkahulu kingdom. They held a big wedding party in the palace and they crowned Maharaja Sakti
            as the new king of Bangkahulu kingdom with Putri Gading Cempaka as the queen. Together, they rebuilt the kingdom and moved the palace into a new location at Kuala Sungai Lemau. When the construction process was complete, they changed the name
            of the kingdom into Sungai Lemau kingdom.</p>
